Finding of the missed values in the adjacency matrix of a big undirected weighted graph by utilizing **probabilistic graphical models**.
The adjacency matrix's values were modeled with Poisson distribution and Gamma prior.
Three approaches were investigated for solving the problem including **EM algorithm**, **Variational Inference**, and **Gibbs sampling** method.
